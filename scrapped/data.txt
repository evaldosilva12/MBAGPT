As a result, the initial intensity and thickness will fade, and the desired color shade will start appearing after the first 3 weeks. At about the 6-8 week mark, you should be scheduled to do your “touch up” procedure especially if you would like to make any changes to the shape of your brow, or fill in any areas needing correction or modification. During this “touch up” procedure, the eyebrow tattoo artist will go over your eyebrows again, exactly repeating the initial session. This repetition helps the tattoo last longer and encourages the ink to embed more permanently into the skin. \\ Beaming White Teeth Whitening \\ Beaming White Teeth Whitening \\ The Beaming white System is a professional light-activated teeth whitening system that combines the strongest, freshest gels with our high-powered Futura 2400 blue LED teeth whitening light. \\ Ultimate teeth whitening (1h 30min) \\ $195 \\ Touch up teeth whitening (50min) \\ $130 \\ Solorzano Spa Ltd. \\ Located in the heart of downtown Red Deer, Alberta, \\ Solorzano Spa \\ offers a variety of services and products!
